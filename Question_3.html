    <p> The selected Dataset is from kaggle which contains information about kickstarter-projects. The data was provided by a company based in Brooklyn, New York. This dataset is from the year 2018. My hope is that we will be able to analyse the dataset too obtain critical insights into the development of crow-funding projects.</p>
	<p> The dataset was filtered using python. The data that were extracted are the name of the project, the main category it belongs to, date it was launched, the current state of the project, the country where the project is based from and finally the amount of money they have received in USD.</p>

<td style="vertical-align: top;">Above specifications will generate a bar chart which illustrates the state of all the projects on the platform between the year 2017 and 2018. Hovering over the each of the state will provide us with the exact number of projects that are in that state. </td>

<td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Insight:</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
There seem to be a lot of projects that have failed on the platform. This might indicate that a lot of beginners are interested in this platform and since it is hard to create something for people without experience, they might be failing and thus contributing this phenomenon. There are a quite a few projects that are successful as well and this drives the platform to attract even more people to the platform. Live and successful project can be considered as a positive outcomes whereas the rest of the categories can be considered as negative outcomes.
<p> The chances of a kickstarter-project being successful is around 40 to 45 percent considering that projects that are live can be counted towards being successful.</p></td>

<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Design considerations</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">For comparision of number of projects by category, a bar graph seems to be the most suitable candidate since we can see the values easily and the visualization is quite simple as well. The states are on the X-axis since it will be easy for the person viewing it to read and understand the axis labels. The axis labels are also oriented horizontally to prevent any difficulty a person might encounter while reading. Colors were not used to specify the catergories since there are too many of them and it would lead to sensory overload. The ability to hover and get the number of projects is again present in this graph as well.
