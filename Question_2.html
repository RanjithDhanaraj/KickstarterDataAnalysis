    <p> The selected Dataset is from kaggle which contains information about kickstarter-projects. The data was provided by a company based in Brooklyn, New York. This dataset is from the year 2018. My hope is that we will be able to analyse the dataset too obtain critical insights into the development of crow-funding projects.</p>
	<p> The dataset was filtered using python. The data that were extracted are the name of the project, the main category it belongs to, date it was launched, the current state of the project, the country where the project is based from and finally the amount of money they have received in USD.</p>

<td style="width: 200px; vertical-align: top;"><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Above specifications will generate a bar chart that can help us analyse which of category of kickstarter-projects recieve the most amount of funding. Hovering over the category will provide us with the exact funding for projects in a particular category and in a particular state.</td>

<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Insight:</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
We can observe from the previous graphs that the rankings are more or less the same when compared to the funding each category receives. Design takes the lead in terms of funding followed by Games and then Technology. When it comes it funding that is wasted due to either the project being cancelled, suspended or failing, Design and Technology come in first and second place respectively and games follows as the third category. Every other category other than the top 3 pale in comparison in terms of funding. Even though there are plenty of projects related to Films, Music and Publishing they do not get nearly enough funding.
<p> This graph helps in visualing the trending in the world right now. With the world integrating with technology at a rapid pace, more people are inclined to fund projects that are closely related to the world of technology.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Design considerations</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">For comparison funding received for projects by category, a bar graph seems to be the most suitable candidate since we can see the values easily and the visualization is quite simple as well. The categories are on the Y-axis since it will be easy for the person viewing it to read and understand the axis labels. Color attribute was used to visualize the different states the project is at.

<P>Preprocessing is done using python and processed data is saved into new CSV file.</p>
<p>1. For preprocessing the data, loaded the data into pandas Dataframe.</p>
<p>2. Name of the project, the main category it belongs to, date it was launched, the current state of the project, the country where the project is based from and finally the amount of money they have received in USD were selected </p>
<p>3. Selected Data from just a 2 years and ignored the rest</p>      
<p>4. Filled null values with Unspecified, Misc, 0-0-0 0:0, undefined, Other and 0 with the respective columns.</p>
<p>5. For better comparison "usd_pledged" attributed is transformed into millions.</p>
