    <p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickstarter Dataset</a>.</p>
    <p> Dataset i have choosen is from the kickstrater Platform. Based in Brooklyn, New York, Kickstarted is an American Public Benefit corporation that maintains a global crowdfunding for different platforms and is focused on creativity. The moto followed by the company is "help bring creative projects to life". The stats for kickstrater as of december 2019 are they have received more than $4.6 billion in pledges from 17.2 million backers to fund 445,000 projects, such as films, music, stage shows, comics, journalism, video games, technology, publishing, and food-related projects.</p>
	<p> So that main dataset has more than 350 thousands of records, so i have filtered the dataset which will contain projects only launched in 2017 and 2018. There are multiple project attributes like, ID, Project Name, Project Category, date & time when it was launched, target date, amount pledged in both USD & local currency and status of the project.</p>

<td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Insight:</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
As observed in the first graph, top catergory which raised highest number of amount is Games and at the bottom is journalism. As shows that most of the donors are interested in donatimg for Games category projects. The next in demand categories are Technology and Design. But as seen in the second graph, many projects were made in Films & Video and Music categories. Out of all the projects maximum of them were made in Films & Vide, Music, Publishing, Games and Technology. Like these are the top 5 categories respectively, with many projects when compareed to others. It is evident enough that people were very much interested in Media (Video, Film, and Music) category projects in year 2017 and early time of 2018. As seen in the stacked graph, we can see there are failed projects more when compared to others for each category. This might be due to projects not being up to the mark so that it can attract crowd or they couldnt fulfill the needs even after getting the required funding. Many categories have terminated cases, not many but few. Also there are only few categories where they have projects state as undefined where they can be either suspended or cancelled.
<p> Even after having maximum number of projects launched in film & videos and Music category they still were not popular enough to attract donors for their project.</p></td>

<td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Design considerations</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">1st Graph: For the first graph i have used a simple bar where i compared quantitative attributes to categorical attributes. As simple bar graphs are an effective way to compare quantitative attributes to categorical attributes. Later on sorted the data descending so that the comparison between the graphs can be made easy.
<p>2nd Graph: Again i have used a stacked bar where effectively we can see the larger category divided into smaller subcategories and how much each sub-section contribute to the total count of the respective category. So the subcategories are of 5 types, so i have divided the bar into 5 different subcategories using the state attribute (Categorical attribute) which indcates the project outcome and these 5 subcategories are Successful, Failed, Live, Terminated & undefined. I could have used a grouped bar chart instead of the stacked one, but as there are many categories it would be really difficult to read the read, congestion issues. Even the stacked bar is at times difficult to read when we have more number of sections in it. As they are not aligned to the comman baseline comparing them becomes a tediuos task. So tooltip is what i used to overcome this issue where when you hover the mouse, details for each section is seen. To combine both the charts i have used hconcat operator.

<td style="vertical-align: top;"> <p style="font-weight: bold;">Data Preprocessing & Filtering:</p>
<P>Preprocessing is done using python and processed data is saved into new CSV file.</p>
<p>1. For preprocessing the data, loaded the data into pandas Dataframe.</p>
<p>2. The next thing to do was to check if the dataset had any missing values. The most missing values were found in "usd_pledged" column and i have dropped that column.Instead of that i will be using "usd_pledged_real" column for analysis as this column is conversion of "pledged" column into US dollars from the original country.</p>
<p>3. Converted the launched date format from MM:DD:YYYY HH:MM:SS to MM:DD:YYYY</p>
<p>4. No duplicate records were found when checked for using the "ID" column which is different of each Project.</p>      
<p>5. So "state" attribute had suspended and cancalled as one of the values. Converted these values as terminated and replaced at the same place for analysis. So "state" attribute has 5 Categories in it.</p>
<p>6. Filtere the dataset and stored all the projects which were launched in 2017 and 2018. Most of the projects are launched in 2017 and few were launched in.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Data Transformation:</p>
<p> 1. For better comparison "usd_pledged_real" attributed is transformed into millions.</p>
