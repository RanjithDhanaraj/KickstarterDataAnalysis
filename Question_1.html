    <p> The selected Dataset is from kaggle which contains information about kickstarter-projects. The data was provided by a company based in Brooklyn, New York. This dataset is from the year 2018. My hope is that we will be able to analyse the dataset too obtain critical insights into the development of crow-funding projects.</p>
	<p> The dataset was filtered using python. The data that were extracted are the name of the project, the main category it belongs to, date it was launched, the current state of the project, the country where the project is based from and finally the amount of money they have received in USD.</p>

<td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Insight:</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
We can see that most of the kickstarter-projects are oriented towards entertainment.
The top catergory which generates the most number of projects is Games and the category with the least number of projects is Dance.  The next category that is in demand is Technology. Out of all the projects most of them were made in Films & Vide, Music, Publishing, Games and Technology. These are the top 5 categories, with many projects when compareed to others. It is evident enough that people were very much interested in Media (Video, Film, and Music) category projects in year 2017 and early time of 2018. In this age when Gaming industry has generated more revenue than Hollywood, it is not surprising that there are a lot of kickstarter-projects related towards gaming.
<p> This graph implies that most people have ideas relating to Media when they start out with a kickstarter-project.</p></td>

<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Design considerations</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">For comparision of number of projects by category, a bar graph seems to be the most suitable candidate since we can see the values easily and the visualization is quite simple as well. The categories are on the Y-axis since it will be easy for the person viewing it to read and understand the axis labels.
